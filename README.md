# DA623_Assignment

Author: Chanchal Yadav (200122021)

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that provides an explanation and implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) used as a regression approach.

## Dataset

The code utilizes the Car price dataset, which provides essential features required for regression analysis.

## Files included

- `DA623_200122021.ipynb`: Python notebook containing the assignment code.
- `CarPrice_Assignment.csv`: File containing the dataset used in the tutorial.

## Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the project scripts:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Before running the scripts, you need to install several required libraries. Use pip to install these dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas seaborn scikit-learn

3. **Update Dataset Path:** Ensure the dataset path is correctly updated in the scripts to reflect your local setup.
4. **Run the Scripts:** Execute the Python scripts to utilize PCA as a regression approach.
